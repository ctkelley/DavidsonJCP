To use the code, start a matlab command window, 
type KSSOLV_Startup in this directory to set up all paths.

To run the C60 example, cd into the 'example' directory, type

runC60_davidson 

to run the Davidson method with 3 different choices of ecut values (mesh parameter).

Type 

runC60_lobpcg

to run the LOBPCG method with 3 different choices of ecut values (mesh parameter).



At this point (June, 2017), KSSOLV appears to need MATLAB version R2013b or higher. Some earlier versions may not work due to the change of syntax in the repmat function.
