tar xf codesv3.tar
cd codesv3/build
cmake ..
make rmg-cpu

Copy the executable into this directory and then run the
executable for each of the three grid densities.
(Exact commands may vary depending on your hardware and mpi implementation).

mpirun -np 16 ./rmg-cpu input32 > output32
mpirun -np 16 ./rmg-cpu input48 > output48
mpirun -np 16 ./rmg-cpu input64 > output64

The Davidson norms used in the paper may be extracted from the output
