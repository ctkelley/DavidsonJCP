This directory contains the files used to generate the tables and figures in Section 3.2.  The transport solver is contained in the Polaris module within the SCALE code (version 6.3).  SCALE is export controlled with designation 0D999 from the US Department of Commerce.  Access to the source code is managed by the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center (RSICC) and can be requested at https://rsicc.ornl.gov/.

Polaris input files for all mesh resolutions can be found in `inputs`.  Corresponding output files can be found in `outputs`.  The preconditioner is a hard-coded constant in Polaris and required re-compiling to produce the "1 Richardson" vs. "5 Richardson" results.  Geometry images for all meshes are located in `mesh_plots` and were produced automatically by Polaris during execution.  The Matlab script `section31_figures.m` produces Figure 3.
